Devnest
============

What is DevNest?
-----------------

Twitter Developer Nest, known generally as DevNest, is a developer event for users of the Twitter API in London, United 
Kingdom. It is hosted every month at the offices of the world famous newspaper, The Guardian.

This application is designed in order to give the community a way to stay up to date with the events. It includes by 
default information like:

- the time, date and location of the next event.
- discussion on Twitter about the events using the hashtag #devnest
- tweets from the official DevNest account, @devnest
- the agenda of the next event

### What's new in version 1.0.1?

This is just a quick update to mirror the version 1.0.1 for iPhone. I have changed the about screen slightly, and have fixed some problems with the @devnest and #devnest screens. I have added an alert to the #devnest screen explaining the lack of tweets, which is due to some problems that Twitter are having with their API. Version 1.1 is currently being planned, and you can view the plans in the readme of [devnest-iphone](http://www.github.com/timrogers/devnest-iphone).

What resources are used in this project?
----------------------------------------

This project would not be possible without two important open source applications, both available on GitHub:

- [jQTouch](http://github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch) - this is used to create the iPhone style interface that is so 
familiar to developers today. jQTouch is a really great project and I would encourage everyone to use it. It's brilliant 
whether you want to create web applications or even native applications using...
- [PhoneGap](http://github.com/sintaxi/phonegap) - this is used to convert the web application into a native Android application for publishing on the Android Market. This is a really brilliant project, in that it also supports other platforms such as iPhone, Palm WebOS and Blackberry. An iPhone version of this project is already [published on GitHub](http://github.com/timrogers/devnest-iphone).

### What is the _resources directory for though?

That directory just contains the screenshots that I've uploaded to the Android market. Nothing exciting, just thought it might be a good idea to include them in the spirit of openness!

What should I do with this?
---------------------------

I'd love to see people remixing this project to make their own similar iPhone applications, or even improving my effort 
here. I would wholeheartedly welcome people improve the DevNest project, as this app is by no means perfect. I just 
wanted to make something and then get it out to the online community to enjoy.

I'd also quite like to see versions of the app for other platforms on which it is not currently available, like WebOS, Blackberry and Symbian. Please feel free to take the HTML assets and compile them with PhoneGap to these platforms and just upload them to the relevant stores!

__If you can, please try to improve the performance of this project. On the simulator running on my well-specced PC, the performance is dreadful. I have no way of finding out whether this is the case on real devices. If you find that it is once you've downloaded it from the Market or built it yourself, please tell me as soon as you can (contact me at tim[at]carnochanrogersDOTcoDOTuk) or even make your own improvements and send me a pull request!__
